            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>
                As a Computer Science student with a solid academic foundation, I’ve built a strong technical background in software development, algorithms, and system design. My journey combines hands-on leadership with global perspective: serving as a Resident Assistant at the University of Georgia, I’ve led diverse communities, managed crises, and developed high-level communication and conflict-resolution skills.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through immersive study abroad programs in Costa Rica and South Korea, I’ve conducted ecological field research, collaborated with international peers, and expanded my understanding of global systems and cultural dynamics. These experiences have sharpened my ability to adapt quickly, solve complex problems under pressure, and lead with clarity. I’m now focused on applying these skills to build clean, efficient code and scalable software solutions that solve real-world challenges.
